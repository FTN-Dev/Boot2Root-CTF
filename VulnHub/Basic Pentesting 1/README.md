## Description

This is a small boot2root VM created for a university cyber security group. It contains multiple remote vulnerabilities and multiple privilege escalation vectors. The author tested the VM on VirtualBox (recommended). It has also been reported to work on VMware, but that was not personally tested by the author.

This VM is specifically intended for newcomers to penetration testing — difficulty is aimed at beginners.

**Goal:** Remotely attack the VM and gain root privileges. After completing the main path, try to discover other vectors that may have been missed.

If you enjoyed the VM or have questions, contact the author: **[josiah@vt.edu](mailto:josiah@vt.edu)**

If you finish the VM, please consider posting a writeup to help others.

* Run unknown VM images in an isolated environment (host-only or on an isolated network) to avoid exposing your host/network.
* Snapshot or backup your host before importing the OVA.
* Prefer VirtualBox if you want behavior closest to the author's testing.
* Disable bridge networking unless you understand the risks and have permission to use the network segment.
