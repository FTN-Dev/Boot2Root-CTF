## Description

This is a small boot2root VM created for a university cyber security group. It contains multiple remote vulnerabilities and multiple privilege escalation vectors. The author tested the VM on VirtualBox (recommended). It has also been reported to work on VMware, but that was not personally tested by the author.

This VM is specifically intended for newcomers to penetration testing — difficulty is aimed at beginners.

**Goal:** Remotely attack the VM and gain root privileges. After completing the main path, try to discover other vectors that may have been missed.

If you enjoyed the VM or have questions, contact the author: **[josiah@vt.edu](mailto:josiah@vt.edu)**

If you finish the VM, please consider posting a writeup to help others.

## Safety & Run Notes

* Run unknown VM images in an isolated environment (host-only or on an isolated network) to avoid exposing your host/network.
* Snapshot or backup your host before importing the OVA.
* Prefer VirtualBox if you want behavior closest to the author's testing.
* Disable bridge networking unless you understand the risks and have permission to use the network segment.

# Basic Pentesting 1 Walktrough

### First Step

paling pertama tentu saja kita scanning IP dari target, mari kita gunakan tools `arp-scan`

```bash
arp-scan -l
```

kemudian outputnya akan begini

```bash
Interface: eth0, type: EN10MB, MAC: 08:00:27:d4:54:92, IPv4: 192.168.56.105
WARNING: Cannot open MAC/Vendor file ieee-oui.txt: Permission denied
WARNING: Cannot open MAC/Vendor file mac-vendor.txt: Permission denied
Starting arp-scan 1.10.0 with 256 hosts (https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan)
192.168.56.1    0a:00:27:00:00:09       (Unknown: locally administered)
192.168.56.100  08:00:27:c1:54:ee       (Unknown)
192.168.56.110  08:00:27:d8:0b:51       (Unknown)
192.168.56.111  08:00:27:eb:6e:8f       (Unknown)

4 packets received by filter, 0 packets dropped by kernel
Ending arp-scan 1.10.0: 256 hosts scanned in 1.971 seconds (129.88 hosts/sec). 4 responded
```

ya, IP yang digunakan target adalah `192.168.56.111` karena aku tau dari guest session si VM.
